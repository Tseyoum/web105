    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>Photography is a passion of mine whenever I venture out, eagerly capturing moments that resonate 
        with me. Each photograph holds within it a multitude of memories, each frame unfolding narratives 
        of specific moments or days. It's this ability of a single image to encapsulate numerous stories 
        that deeply resonates with me, fueling my love and fascination for the art of photography.</p>
